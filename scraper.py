### where the first index is the row number, and
### the second index is either a '\n' newline character
### or an element from the row
### (for example, 'trs[1][3]' could return '<td>0.1.0</td>', the version)

### however, we still need to output the contents to a text file
### named 'requirements.txt' and remove the quotations around the names
### so the 'requirements.txt' file can be read properly;

# should go to the directory of the virtual environment;
# assign to 'pth'
pth = '/home/william/Desktop/'

# create file name 'requirements.txt'; of course, the name of the
# file is arbitrary as long as we remember to use the corret name when
# calling 'python3 -m pip install -r <requirements.txt>' (although if
# the project will be pushed to github, it is probably best to stick
# with the traditional standard, especially since others might have
# personal scripts that use the name 'requirements.txt');
# we also cycle through packages and write each package name to a new
# line, while removing the quotes around the name;
with open(pth + 'requirements.txt', 'w+') as file:
